check if the current grub.cfg is up to date with /etc/default/grub
check if other operating systems are there by executing os prober and if it takes too long then use grub.cfg to find out
and then if other operating systems are there instruct the user to use 0.0 instead of 0 in timeout

add UEFI support



possible issue : when grub-update hasnt been performed since change of an os so entries from grub.cfg are false

check what happens when a dual boot os removed from hard drive but selected as default entry in grub
